        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A churro is a cinnamon- and sugar-topped fried pastry dough stick 
            with Spanish and Portuguese origins. Churros are similar to doughnuts, 
            but they have ridges because they are piped out of a pastry bag. 
            Because they are fried instead of baked, churros have a fluffy 
            and tender interior with a satisfyingly crispy exterio</p>
